# Arduino IoT Training using NodeMCU

This code is for MQTT connection using NodeMCU to HiveMQ MQTT public broker. This training will use NodeMCU with Node-RED as an IoT middleware to communicate with Telegram, Web Dashboard and MySQL database.

## The hardware used here are :

1. NodeMCU
2. Temperature sensor: LM35 or DHT11

## Libraries used :

1. SimpleDHT - https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/simpledht/
2. MQTT - https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/mqtt/


HiveMQ MQTT is used as public broker (https://www.hivemq.com).
